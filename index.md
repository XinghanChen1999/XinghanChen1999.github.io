## Research Interests

- Urban Morphology
- Urban Equity
- Digital Humanities
- Computational Design

My current research focuses on measuring global cityscapes using Street View images and constructing a cultural genealogy (my master's thesis topic). I excel in using quantitative methods such as spatial analysis (ArcGIS), deep learning, and machine vision to analyze spatial issues and measure urban quality.
