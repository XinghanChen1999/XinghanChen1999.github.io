Here is **Xinghan Chen (é™ˆæ˜Ÿæ±‰)**.

I am a Master's candidate in the College of Architecture and Urban Planning (CAUP) at Tongji University. Currently, I am serving as a research assistant at the Computational Urban Design Lab, under the guidance of [Prof. Yu Ye](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Ye-10).

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at 2230078@tongji.edu.cn

## Academic Background

## Research Interests

- Urban Morphology
- Urban Equity
- Digital Humanities
- Computational Design

My current research focuses on measurements of cityscapes and the construction of a global genealogy (my master's thesis topic). I excel in using quantitative methods such as spatial analysis (ArcGIS), deep learning, and machine vision to analyze spatial issues and measure urban quality. In the future, I wish to dedicate myself to promoting urban inclusiveness and preserving cultural diversity -- two meaningful and exciting directions.
