## Travel

<br>Traveling allows me to experience the unique cultures of cities around the world. In addition to exploring China, I have visited the United Kingdom, Japan, and Serbia. These journeys have enriched my understanding of the cultural contexts and architectural characteristics of different cities, continually fueling my curiosity and passion for urban studies.

## Cooking

<br>There must be **something truly magical** about standing on stage to give a fantastic speech, which considerably lifts my spirits and energizes my entire body. If you desire to master a specific knowledge in depth, just give a prelection. If you can explain to others for complete understanding, you are already an expert. I really enjoy the accomplishment of imparting my knowledge to others, so what I strive for is to be **a student's favorite professor** at the [best universities in my hometown].

## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.

## My Cat

She is my love. Her name is Qbao (QÂÆù).
