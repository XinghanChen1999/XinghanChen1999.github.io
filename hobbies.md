<br>Traveling is the best way to explore cities. From my travels, I feel the complexity and unique charm of each city. This inspired me to choose urban studies as my future career. I enjoy comparing books about cities with my travel experiences; it's very interesting. As an old Chinese saying goes: "Read ten thousand books, travel ten thousand miles."

## Cooking

<br>Cooking is my daily way to relax. Trying different recipes and exploring ingredients from various countries is exciting. Cooking requires a sense of control and attention to each detail. Nothing is more rewarding than cooking and sharing good food.
